# A Smarthome project with a Button-device and PC connection

the project: A button device which can send informations with a 433mHz rf-module to a ESP32. This ESP sends commands over the network to a pc where it changes the volume etc. The ESP is an Interface for many other things like a thermostat or anything else. Otherwise the buttons can enable / disable a rgb-strip which is controlled by a self-designed controllrl and they can control wirreles sockets.
